The notebook was too large to be put in github, I was able to include it as a .py file so you can view all of the code and read the comments I put in there. The notebook is also downloadable through the zip folder
but that is the same as if you were to just open it through the first deliverable. Sorry for the inconvenience, I am not trying to hide anything as per the video presentation, just couldn't figure out how to add the 
notebook to this repo.
